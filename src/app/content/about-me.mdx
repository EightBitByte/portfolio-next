![Hotpot with friends.](/hotpot.jpg)

*Sitting down for a dinner with friends on my twentieth birthday, I contemplated who I had become in my twenty years of life. What connections I've made, the things I've learned, the mistakes I've made -- how they all brought me to where I am today.*

### Origin Story and Testimony

I come from a half-chinese, half-spanish family out of a medium-sized town in 
Southern California. Growing up, I was raised Catholic but eventually ended up 
drifting more towards a Protestant faith.

For the longest time, I was a lukewarm Christian, attending mass on Sunday, 
but never attempting to form a solid relationship with God. When I reached 
college, I came to the realization that I couldn't do everything on my own. 

Classes, heartbreak, and a variety of physical and emotional injuries helped 
me see how fragile I truly was. I committed my life to Christ, seeking to put 
Him above all else in my life.

Ever since, I've been a changed man. The glorious works that God has done in 
my life -- the people he's put in it, the lives he's changed with them, and the 
renewal he's afforded me prove His work to me.

### Birth of a Tech Geek

Since the age of three, I've been drawn to technology like segfaults to 
newly-written C code. My earliest memory of computers was plucking out the 
keycaps from my mom's old obsidian-black HP laptop.

From then on, I was drawn into the world of video gaming, computer building, 
and coding. I gravitated more towards video game development, given my innate 
interest in gaming, but learned to enjoy other types of programming, like web 
and software development.

### Inspirations

*A lot of my inspiration to make cool things comes from games and media I consume.*

I draw a lot of inspiration to do what I do from the things I like most. Video 
games and music move me the most when it comes to inspiring and energizing.

[Disco Elysium](https://discoelysium.com/) is to-date, my favorite game of all 
time. We follow an amnesiac detective in a broken world, who relearns how the 
world works, who he is, and most importantly -- what he wants to be.

[Omori](https://www.omori-game.com/en) was one of the games I "binged" during 
the pandemic that gave me a lot of perspective on how people deal with trauma. 
It gave a me a lot to think about and helped me grow in my empathy towards 
those impacted by trauma.

[Forrest Frank](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1scVfBymTr3CeZ4imMj1QJ) are a 
few Christian artists who have been influential for me. Not much more to say -- 
I just really like their beats and lyrics!

### Other Hobbies

On top of the main three (being Christ, lifting, and coding), I also like to 
cook, create digital art, and ocassionally write poetry.

Thanks for checking me out! I hope to talk more about things you and I are 
interested in.
