I'm not ashamed to admit that I have trouble scheduling tasks and using my 
freetime wisely. The allure of wasting time playing video games, doomscrolling
on YouTube or what-have-you is just too strong for me to overcome sometimes.
As such, I attempted to use the tools available to me to fix my shortcomings --
that's where AI enters the picture.

Unless you've been living under a rock for the past three years, you probably 
know about generative AI. Some use it for debugging code, writing emails, as a 
search engine, or even  as an image creation tool[^1]. I, however, decided to do 
something radical: actually *use* the advice it gave me.

[^1]: The ethics and legality of doing such are heavily under debate. If you 
want my `tl;dr`, I think it's unethical unless artists/photographers are being 
compensated for their training data.

I fed ChatGPT a bit of information, such as what days I'm at school, what my 
schedule looks like, and what my goals are for my schedule. My message looked 
a little something like:

> I am a computer science university student seeking to develop a better 
schedule for this upcoming quarter of study.  
> Please help me develop a better schedule keeping the following in mind:
> 1. I'd like to wake up no later than 8am, and go to bed no later than 11pm.
> 2. I am on campus [from x time to y time]
> 3. I do better with a scheduled environment rather than with free space.
> 4. I need a roughly 2 hour block each day for exercise, preferably in the early evening.
> 5. It takes me roughly 45 minutes to get to and from campus.
> 6. I'd like some time every day for religious meditation and reflection.
> 7. I'd like some time every day for projects and personal study.
> 8. I need time every day for work on homework.
> 9. On the weekends, I'd like some time for meal prepping.

It spat out a plaintext schedule, which I modified with its help and imported 
into Google Calendar. After formatting it, it looked like this:

# Putting the Schedule into Practice
On one of the days I did not have class, I decided to follow along with it.

# Conclusions
`tl;dr`: I really enjoyed the schedule it made for me. I never felt like I was 
working on one thing for too long, so as to avoid burnout.

I recommend you try it out! Give it a shot and 
[let me know what you think](mailto:jamoy@uci.edu).

## Pros
I usually have a lot of trouble getting up in the mornings (I like to sleep),
but with this schedule, I found it **easy to get up in the morning** and felt
refreshed by the amount of time I was able to sleep.

I didn't stagnate or procrastinate in my work, because I was always switching
gears; I **never felt trapped or bored** in one topic or unit of work.

I felt **satisified** with the amount of work I did: I was able to push a few 
changes to my personal project's repo, complete a homework assignment, and get
a killer chest pump in the gym.

## Cons
I felt **a little on edge**, trying to scramble to meet the next task assigned to
me. This could be eased with a timer or alarm, so I don't have to keep checking
my phone to see if I'm behind or not.

I found that it scheduled things a little *too close* together, in that I hardly 
had any time to transition between tasks. However, that can be ironed out with 
a simple prompt, like: 
> Give me an extra 30 minutes between the gym and studying in order to get back 
and shower.

# An example prompt for you to use
Copy-paste into your AI companion of choice, replacing the square brackets with
pertinent info. Good luck!
